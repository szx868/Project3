# Data Science Skills

**Team Triple J:** Jered Ataky, Zhouxin Shi, Irene Jacob

## Project Overview:

In this project, our goal is to be able to answer to the question:

“Which are the most valued data science skills?” 

As it is a group work and each member living in different time zone, we have 
established a great way of communication, code sharing, and documentation to
enable us to be successful and efficient while working virtually together.
The tools used and data source explored are described below: 

## Tools:

We are using Github for code sharing. Github serves us also for data repository 
although we intend to use MySQL (and/or AWS) as the project progresses.
In the other, Slack and Microsoft Teams are used for communication as well
project documentation.

## Data Source:

The data set we are working can be found in the link below:

https://www.kaggle.com/elroyggj/indeed-dataset-data-scientistanalystengineer


We also have it loaded as csv in our Github repository for project development:

## Work process & responsabilities

```{r}

Process <- c('Data Collection', 'Database Storage & Structure ',
             'Data Transformation (Cleaning & Tidying data)',
             'Data Analysis', 'Visualization',
             'Review & Summary','Conclusion and Presentation')

Team <- c('Zhouxin', 'Zhouxin & Jered', 'Jered & Irene', 
          'Jered, Zhouxin, Irene', 'Irene', 'Jered',
          'Jered, Zhouxin, Irene')

df_team <- data.frame(Process, Team)

names(df_team) <- c('Process', 'Team Members')

df_team %>%
  kbl(caption = "Work Process & Responsabilities") %>%
  kable_material(c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  row_spec(0, color = "indigo")


```

** Load Data from Cloud storage: this will be the final goal**



## Load data from database

```{r MSQL}

# Access mysql: this is temporary

mydb <-dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), user='root', password='Ja07071990', dbname ='ds_skills', host = '23.251.154.21')

```


```{r}
# Store the result in a dataframe movies

data <- dbGetQuery(mydb, "SELECT * FROM indeed_job_dataset7")
```


```{r}
head(data, 2)


```

## Data Cleansing


### Clean skill

```{r}

# Remove bracket in skill

data_1 <- data %>%
  separate(Skill, c("Alt", "new_skills"), sep = "^[\\[]", remove = TRUE, convert = FALSE) %>%
  separate(new_skills, c("Skill", "Alt"), sep = "[\\]]$", remove = TRUE, convert = FALSE)

data_1 <- data_1[1:3]


```
