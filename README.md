# Data Science Skills

**Team:** Jered Ataky, Zhouxin Shi, Irene Jacob

## Project Overview:

In this project, our goal is to be able to answer to the question:

“Which are the most valued data science skills?” 

As it is a group work and each member living in different time zone, we have 
established a great way of communication, code sharing, and documentation to
enable us to be succesful and efficient while working virtually together.
The tools used and data source explored are described below: 

## Tools:

We are using Github for code sharing. Github serves us also for data repository 
although we intend to use MySQL (and/or AWS) as the project progresses.
In the other, Slack and Microsoft Teams are used for communication as well
project documentation.

## Data Source:

The data set we are working can be found in the link below:

We also have it loaded as csv in our Github repository for project development:
