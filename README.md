# Data Science Skills

**Team:** Jered Ataky, Zhouxin Shi, Irene Jacob

## Project Overview:

This is a project for your entire class section to work on together, since being able to work effectively on a virtual team is a key “soft skill” for data scientists. Please note especially the requirement about making a presentation during our first meetup after the project is due.

W. Edwards Deming said, “In God we trust, all others must bring data.” Please use data to answer the question, “Which are the most valued data science skills?” Consider your work as an exploration; there is not necessarily a “right answer.”

## Tools Used:

The tool used for code sharing is Github. For communication Slack and Teams are used.
